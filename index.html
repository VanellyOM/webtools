        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is <strong>Vanelly Odette</strong>. My career began with a deep interest in
            <em>finance</em>, which naturally led me to spend several years in the corporate world.
            Over time, I transitioned into the healthcare industry, where I worked in administration and operations.
            Despite this shift, my fascination with the world of finance never waned.
            I realized that combining my knowledge of finance with the power of technology could open exciting new doors.
            That realization motivated me to return to school and pursue software development.
            I wanted to build a strong foundation in coding, algorithms, and applied technology to tackle real-world financial problems.
            This journey is as much about personal growth as it is about professional transformation.

        <h3>Developer Identity</h3>
        <p>
            As a developer, I bring a <strong>unique blend of skills</strong> to the table.
            My background in healthcare and corporate environments gives me a broad perspective on how systems, people, and data interact.
            I consider myself a problem-solver and a continuous learner, eager to explore cross-disciplinary connections.
            My passion lies in leveraging <em>technology</em> to improve workflows, enhance decision-making, and create tools that increase efficiency—especially within finance.
            I am particularly drawn to the intersection of programming and financial theory, envisioning solutions that combine data analysis, algorithms, and quantitative finance.
            This approach allows me to build practical, impactful applications that can improve real-world processes.

        <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Returning to school has been transformative.
            Immersing myself in <em>software fundamentals</em> such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming has strengthened my technical skills.
            I have developed a keen interest in understanding the mechanisms behind financial systems—from algorithmic trading strategies to market simulations.
            My goal is to translate theoretical knowledge into tangible projects, such as building stock market simulators and budgeting tools.
            Each project deepens my understanding and adds to my portfolio.
            Although the path is challenging, I am fully committed to growing and carving out my niche within the tech-finance ecosystem.
            This ongoing journey is fueled by curiosity, determination, and a desire to make a meaningful impact.
        </p>
